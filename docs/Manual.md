# Integrate Ad Formats Manually

**Manual mode** is a way of serving ads in your apps where the publisher manually adjusts ad
placements and does all of the ad management on their own.

Since **Manual mode** allows for more customization compared to Dynamic method, it's recommended for
advanced users.

**Note**: Before continuing, ensure you have configured an in-app ad unit ID from your Next
Millennium contact.

**Note:** always work with in-app ads in main thread.

The doc show how to display ads in **Manual mode**.
